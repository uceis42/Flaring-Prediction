# Flaring-Prediction
This is the code and final dataset for the dissertation.

The XGBoost model can be found in XGboost.ipynb

The XGBoost model with filtered data can be found in XGboost-with 20 history.ipynb
Predicted and Actual Flaring Gap Scatter Plot is also in the same notebook

The Logistic Regression model can be found in model_only_LR.ipynb

The Logistic Regression model with Gradient Boosted Decision Tree can be found in model_GBDT_LR.ipynb
Correlation Table is also in the same notebook

The RNN model can be found in RNN_model.ipynb
Training and Validation Loss over Epochs chart is in the same notebook


Flaring Scatter Plots are created in Viz_FT_Article.ipynb
